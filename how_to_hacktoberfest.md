# How to Host a Hacktoberfest Event

The [Hacktoberfest Event Organizers website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources/eventorganizers) has a lot of great resources to host an event.

One way is to hold an event every Thursday at 6 pm. One kick off meetings and then weekly standup meetings. 

The kickoff meeting will explain how to get registered and how to participate. 

The weekly calls are to stay connected.
